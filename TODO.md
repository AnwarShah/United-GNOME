# Curved window corners
Black background behind curved corners after a window is maximized and restored. Disappears when focus is shifted to another window.

# GTK2
GTK2 apps only have their headerbars curved.

# Assets
Border color is too light for check/radio boxes, possibly make the same shade as the fg color

# Shell
Hijack DTD's indicators to make the custom indicators have an on/off option.
Make more analogous to GTK3 theme -> active and hover states for image buttons
Double-check light variant
Tidy extensions.scss

# SCSS
Get rid of unused variables.

# Compact
Go full Unity 8 and make the headerbars as super thin as possible. Everything else will only be slightly reduced in size.

# Epiphany Incognito Mode
Right now it follows Adwaita's styling, but customizing it doesn't _seem_ to be possible.
