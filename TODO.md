# Curved window corners
Black background behind curved corners after a window is maximized and restored. Disappears when focus is shifted to another window. GTK2 apps also only have their headerbars curved.

# Assets
(Modified) Adwaita assets will be used for the checkboxes as well as the cursor handle and slider for marked scales
Window buttons

# Compact
Go full Unity 8 and make the headerbars as super thin as possible. Everything else will only be slightly reduced in size

# Slider and Scale
Improve both, especially in dark variant

# Shell
Hijack DTD's indicators

# SCSS
Get rid of unused variables
