# Assets

- Window buttons?

# Login theme

- The Shell login styling is still using the old style. I have no idea how to test it though

# Shell

- A bug report might need to be submitted for this. : The last keyboard key touched when using the on-screen keyboard is left in the hover state but that just makes the key look like it's stuck.

# Compact GTK3 Variant

- Make a compact version. Going super thin a la Unity 8 didn't look as good as I hoped

# Epiphany Incognito Mode

- Right now it follows Adwaita's styling, but customizing it doesn't _seem_ to be possible.
