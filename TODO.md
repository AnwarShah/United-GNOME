Everything on this list is moreorless low priority.

# Assets
- Window buttons?

# Login theme
- The styling for the login dialog is untested but I need to find a way to actually test it outside of compiling everything and copying it to /usr/share/gnome-shell. I'm not sure how, but on UG 17.04, the styling actually worked for the logged in user's lock screen but I can't seem to get that behavior again.

# Shell
- A bug report might need to be submitted for this : The last keyboard key touched when using the on-screen keyboard is left in the "hover" state but that just makes the key look like it's stuck. The on-screen keyboard doesn't seem to go into the active state when a key is touched.

# Compact GTK3 Variant
- Make a compact version.

# Epiphany Incognito Mode
- Right now it follows Adwaita's styling, but customizing it doesn't _seem_ to be possible.
