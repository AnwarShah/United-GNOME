Every distro needs 10 colored assets:


$distro-launcher.svg. The dimensions need to be 88x88 and be centered on a 120x120 page.
checkbox.svg
corner-ripple-ltr.svg and corner-ripple-rtl.svg are the same color as $accent_color.
$dash-placeholder
$more-results
$process-working
$toggle-on
$window-close
$window-close-active

Every variant uses the files in the common-assets folder. Light variants need those files as well along with the ones in the common-assets-light folder where those would overwrite any assets that may already exist assuming you copied the contents of the common-assets into the light variant's folder first.

You don't need a launcher file for an agnostic variant.
